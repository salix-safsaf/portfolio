### NASA Mission Control

On computer: did not work :warning:

I contacted the lecturer after researching and not knowing the cause of the problem... and waiting to discuss the issue.

#### About the NASA project:

- The first problem: I have re-watched the explanation several times and applied all the steps, but the names of the planets do not appear in the drop-down list. Although it appears on the console.

- The second problem: I think it is a result of the previous problem.. I can't aport the mission by pressing the (X) sign even though I have applied all the steps as well.
