# Complete NodeJS Developer in 2022 (GraphQL, MongoDB, + more)

## Projects

1. Planet Finder
2. NASA Mission Control ⚠️
3. Multiplayer Pong

⚠️ Clarification: Because of a problem with the NASA project... and the time that passed trying to fix it... I just listened to the course (parts 12 to 17) without focus or application. I will listen to the course again inshallah to try to fix the problem in the project and to focus more.
