# Serverless-Stack-project

On computer: did not work ⚠️

[Learn SST: Serverless (Links) app.](https://docs.sst.dev/learn/)
A tutorial to build your first app with SST.

I tried to create this project but it didn't work because the site console didn't work..it opened once or twice and then stopped working. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I could not complete the project.

The console stops at this point, as in the picture.. I tried to search for solutions and could not find. I will try again, God willing.
